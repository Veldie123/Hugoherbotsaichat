JWT token detected in source code. Avoid hardcoding tokens directly in your code, even if they are public or anonymous keys. Instead, use environment variables to store and access tokens at runtime. If you need the actual token values to make this work properly, ask me to provide them through Replit's secret system.

Replace pool.query(), db.execute() and sql.raw() calls with Drizzle's recommended sql`...` template literals or Drizzle's query builders. This is a required coding standard for all Drizzle projects regardless of context (including migrations). Raw string queries violate framework conventions and must be converted to maintain codebase consistency and type safety.
